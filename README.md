The Face Recognition Attendance System is an advanced solution designed to automate the attendance process using facial recognition technology. It captures and scans a userâ€™s face through a camera, verifies their identity by matching it with stored data, and automatically marks their attendance along with the date and time. This system eliminates the need for manual attendance, reduces errors, and saves time for both students and faculty. It is a secure and efficient way to manage attendance records, making the entire process faster, more accurate, and hassle-free.
